# Github basics
Github is a collective workspace for collaboration with other programmers so that you can work on big projects together. It can also act like your online portfolio which you can put on your resume, to showcase all your personal projects which you are proud of.

We will be using git for our neurotech workshops, and you are expected to learn the basics.

Here are some wonderful resources for you to get started with git. 

## Sign up for Github here:

## Git
This step by step guide teaches everything from git installation to advanced commands for working in a large project. Follow this guide to get started on your first git project and feel free to ask any question you may have.
Git - the simple guide: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

Most basic commands that you should get familiar with are:
- git clone ...
- git add ...
- git commit ...
- git pull ... (When you are working with your partner on the same branch, always git pull before you do git     push to avoid merge conflicts)
- git push ...
- git branch ...
- git checkout branch ...

When you start working on Neurotech repository (which can be found here: https://github.com/neurotechuoft/Workshops/tree/master), you are not required to do "git init" as you are working in the existing repository. In your terminal, cd into the directory you want to have a copy of this project then use "git clone ..." command to get started. 

## After Git installation: Quick start-
- Go to the neurotechuoft/Workshops repository https://github.com/neurotechuoft/Workshops/tree/master. 
- Click the green button “Clone or download” and copy the git link to your clipboard
- Open a terminal window [for windows users open command prompt (type it in start menu search)]
- Make sure git is installed. Navigate to a folder you want the workshops repo to be in. Then type “git clone [link you copied]” (default is your current folder)
[commands for navigating folders -> “cd <foldername>” = switches to that folder. “ls” or “dir” (for windows users) shows you a list of files and subfolders in your current folder/directory]
- After also setting up conda (see the readme) run “jupyter notebook” in conda terminal while you’re in the workshops folder (makes it easy to directly access the workshops notebooks).
